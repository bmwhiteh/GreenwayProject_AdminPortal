# GreenwayProject_AdminPortal
This is Team 3 Repository for the IPFW/ City of Fort Wayne Admin Portal

# List of Commented Pages
1. AppPoolInfo.aspx - gets the current username 
2. Default.aspx - landing page for login, currently displays many graphs
3. HeatMap.aspx - Provides the Heat Map with activity received from users on Trail Use.
4. Login.aspx - User Interface for Login, uses ASP elements for username/password/submit and validation, "Remember Me" & "Forgot User" do not work

6. packages.config - Seems to be the needed drivers, plugins, etc. to allow the functionality of the admin portal
